# I NEED A DOCTOR!

## Notes

This APP it has the ambition to solve the points that have been stablished [here](https://github.com/nisevi/paw/blob/master/trabajos_practicos/tecnologias_del_lado_del_servidor/PAW_TP2_PHP.pdf).

## Setup

You only need to run one command if you want to get it running:

```bash

```

Run the above command in the root directory, meaning where this README.md file lives and the you will find everything working [here](http://localhost:8000/).
